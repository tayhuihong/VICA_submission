Submission for  VICA Tech Assessment

# Assumptions
1. Commas are replaced by decimal points for monthlyPremium and totalPremium as they are supposed to be of type float.
2. 'no term life policy taken' and 'term life policy not taken' means insuree has no term life insurance
3. NA values will be replaced with integer 0 for healthRiders, assuming insurees left it blank because they have no riders on their health policies.
